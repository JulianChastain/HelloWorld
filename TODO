1) Create frontend that will display next word from nextWord.py at half opacity as the next nextWord
2) Create nextWord.py to interface with data structure (.pickle file?) to find the next nextWord
3) Create a way to store the markov chain such that we only have to parse the data once. (chain.py)
4) Create a way to parse some arbitrary amount of word data
