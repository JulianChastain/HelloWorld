When you leave I'm begging you not to go,
Call your name two three times in a row,

Such a funny thing for me to try to explain,
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame.
'Cause I know I don't understand,
Just how your love can do what no one else can.

Your love.

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

When I talk to my friends so quietly,
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me,
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress,
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress,

It's the way that you know what I thought I knew,
It's the beat my heart skips when I'm with you,
But I still don't understand,
Just how the love you're doing no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now,
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (oh crazy)
Got me looking so crazy right now,
Your touch (you're in love) got me looking so crazy right now (love!)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now,
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy
Your love's got me looking, got me looking so crazy
Your love.

I'm looking so crazy
Your love's got me looking, got me looking so crazy your love.

[Jay-Z (Beyonce):]
I'm on that now, let's go
Young Hov y'all know when the flow is loco,
Young B and the R-O-C
O.G. Big Homie, the one and only,
Stick bony,
But the pocket is fat like Tony,
Soprano the ROC handle like Van Exel,
I shake phonies man, you can't get next to,
The genuine article I do not sing though,
I sling though, if anything I bling yo,

Star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret
Crazy bring your whole set,
Jay-Z in the range,
Crazy and deranged,
They can't figure them out they like hey is he insane

Yes sir I'm cut from a different cloth,
My texture is the best fur: chinchilla.
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
I've been iller than chain smokers,
How you think I got the name Hova?
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
I been realer the game's over,
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
Fall back young, ever since I made the change over
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
To platinum the game's been a wrap, one!

[Beyonce:]
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this,
I've been playing myself, baby I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me,
And baby you're making a fool of me,
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees,
'Cause baby you got me, you got me so crazy baby

Slowly as Sir Luscious step up like a Q-Dawg
A-town’s up, deuces down it’s the new call
And you can dial 1-888-CUT-SOMETHING
I’m your kinky operator when you wanna fuck something

Ain’t no dial tones just milestones, of pleasure to reach
To each his own, I’m a stone cold Aquarian freak
Humanitarian, barbarian but under the sheets
It’s the player from the Point
And your girl from the D

Are you infatuated with me
I could end your curiosity
If you don't think I'm too rude
Here's your chance to make your move

I sit and wait for nobody
People say that my, my style is so crazy
I think you like it baby
Do you want to get nasty?
I dare you to undress me

Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With this hip hop star
Bad boots on, pants down low
I'm a hip hop star
Baby let me know if you wanna ride with this
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star

Do I blow you away?
Do I stimulate your mind?
Would you taste my love if I kick it tight

I have none to waste with you
I guess you can say
My style is so crazy
I think you like it baby
Do you want to get messy?
I dare you to undress me

Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With this hip hop star
Bamboos on pants down low
I'm a hip hop star
Baby let me know if you wanna ride with this
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star

Undress me, undress me
You can come
Come baby, undress me

Take off that tank top and pull off them drawers
The girls all pause, got them dripping down they sugar walls
Aw naw! Getting to the nappy root
Knocking boots and stilettos, damn I keep it ghetto!

A cool type of fellow, mellow got the gold medal
Never settle for less my rose petal
Tooey, tooey, tooey, tooey! Spit game!
Venom to get it up in ‘em, let me P pop that thang

First check her brain to see if she’s sane
Deranged or strange or crazy as hell
You never can tell these days
Everybody got a little Rick James in they veins, man!

[Sleepy Brown]
The way I feel oh girl I know its bout to be.....
Me all on you and damn girl you all over me

Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With this hip hop star
Bad boots on, pants down low
I'm a rock star
Baby let me know if you wanna ride with this
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star
Ooh baby
I love the way you make me feel
It slows down time
Come in my bedroom and turn off the lights

You whisper softly in my ear
Makes me unwind
The way you touch me
Lets me know you're mine

I'd rather be with you
Because i love the way
You scream my name
And there's no other man
That gives me what i want
And makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you because
You hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy i'd rather be with you

I love the way you look at me
Stare into my eyes
What do they say to you
Boy don't be shy
Tonight's the night your fantasies
Will all come true
I am your woman
I belong to you

There is nothing i won't do for you
I know my soul connected me to you
I feel so safe when i'm alone with you
I'm holding back nothin
Saving it all for you
Baby i love making love to you
It's like a high i can't come down from you

I'd rather be with you
Because i love the way
You scream my name
And there's no other man
That gives me what i want
And makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you because
You hustle hard to take care of me

I don't want nobody else
I ain't goin no where
I'm happy with you
You got me baby
I ain't thinking about
Nobody else but you baby
All the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it out

I can't believe I believed
Everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think
She was from your past
Silly of me to dream of
One day having your kids
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong

I can't believe I fell for your schemes
I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me
You're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete
When you cheat with loose women
Took me some time but now I moved on
Because I realized I got

Me myself and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' be my own best friend

Me myself and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' be my own best friend

So controlling, you say that you love me
But you don't
Your family told me one day
I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing
With your three kids in my home
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong

Now that it's over
Stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend
Tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time
But now I am strong
Because I realized I got

Me myself and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' be my own best friend

Me myself and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' be my own best friend

(I got me, myself and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(Still, I'm about to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again!

(Now I got me, myself and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out

If you've cried a thousand times, ladies you will survive!

I just wanna be with you
I love everything about you
From your old school tennis shoes
To the way you move when you're dancing with me

Do you remember our first kiss
It wasn't long enough
Remember the first time
We spent those weeks together
They were not long enough
All of our conversations
All of your sweet pages
They're never long enough

When it's time for me to leave
It's so hard to say good-bye
I never want to say good-bye
I never ever want to say good-bye

One day we'll make love
Finally i'll be yours
Only you only you
I could love you
It's too late
I already love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
Uhh uhh uhh.
You ready B? Let's go get 'em..

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Look for me! Young, B
Cruisin down the westside - highway
Doing what we like to do - our, way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
all of my dates been blind dates
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me
I'm mashin the gas, she's grabbin the wheel, it's true to the heart
She rides with me - the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during "Sex and the City"
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
Cuz mami's a rider, and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused
So let's, lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B

[Chorus:]
[Jay] All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend.
[Bey] Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend.
[Jay] All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend.
[Bey] Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend.

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin
with the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin
Now they 'bout nothin - if ever you mad about somethin
It won't be that; oh no it won't be that
I don't be at, places where we comfy at
With no be-atch; oh no you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect - nobody walkin this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin that Hermes Burkin bag,
Manolo Blahnik, Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
so don't let the necessary occur, yep!

[Chorus]

[Beyonce]
(Talk to 'em B)
If I was your girlfried,
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you,
Even if that somebody is me
Yeah-hee (break it down for 'em)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
and all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
my love and my trust if you was my boyfriend

[Chorus]
How you doing honey baby
You know I don't ask for much but
For a girl spending time alone can be pretty rough
But I hear a knock on my door
You know it's yours for sure
We can't wait for the bedroom
So we just hit the floor

[Chorus:]
Is y'all alright
I don't know but I know what's happening to me girl
Is y'all alright
Uh, break it down now
Is y'all alright
I don't know but I know what's happening to me, girl
Is y'all alright
Uh, break it down now

See you gotta work it out
See you gotta work it out
A brotha gotta work it out

Child, blow your horn now
Come on, Child, blow your horn now

So we shakin back and forth now
Just keep it coming babe
Treat my body like a guitar
You got to, you got to keep on strumming babe
But in the back of my mind
I wonder is it gonna be the last time
We if there ain't nobody loving and you goin keep it coming
Well baby with me that's fine

[Chorus]

I like this!
Uh, look it here...BRIDGE!

So baby hold me
Like you don't wanna let go
I'm feeling foxy
Cause boy you working it out
Daddy you given me a taste of your honey
I want the whole bee hive
I'm gonna call you my sugar
Cause I (I) had the sweetest time
See you gotta work it out
See you gotta work it out
A brotha gotta work it out

I like it when the horn go [x4]

Ha! Austin better work it out
Ha! Foxy better work it out
Ha! AP3 better work it out
Ha! AP3 better work it out
I remember when you used to take
Me on a bike ride everyday
On the bayou
You remember that? We were inseparable

And I remember when you could do no wrong
You'd come home from work
And I jumped in your arms when I saw you
I was so excited
I was so happy to see you
So happy to see you

Because you love me I overcome
And I'm so proud of what you've become
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I make you're there for me
You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood my fears and you've protected me
I treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why…

I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me

I still remember the expression on your face
When you found out I'd been on a date
And had a boyfriend
My first boyfriend, you should've seen your face

I still remember I called you crying 'cause of my tattoo
Could've said, "Beyoncé, I told you so."
Instead you said you'd get one too
You and my mama said y'all get one just like mine

Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I know you're there for me
You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understand my fears and you've protected me
I treasure every extraordinary memory that's why…

My unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me

Even if my man broke my heart today
No matter how much pain I'm in I will be okay
'Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced
For this love is unconditional it won't go away

I know I'm lucky
Know it ain't easy
For men who take care of their responsibilities
Love is overwhelming
Lord, why did you pick me?
Can't stop the tears from falling
I love you so much, daddy

Thank you
You've done so much for me
I love you, daddy

I get so emotional, daddy, every time I think of you
I get so emotional, daddy, every time I think of you
There is no one else like my daddy
No one else replace my daddy

We ain't birds, we ain't headin' south (Noooo!)
Them one nighters, that's sad and doubt

And Daddy won't you treat him right

Now that you've listened to my story

Swing low, sweet chariot,
Comin' for to carry me home;
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Comin' for to carry me home.

I looked over Jordan,
And WHAT did I see,
Comin' for to carry me home,
A band of angels comin' after me,
Comin' for to carry me home.

[Repeat chorus:]

If you get there before I do,
Comin' for to carry me home,
Tell all my friends I'm comin' too,
Comin' for to carry me home.
Took me a while
But I'm finally here
So I just wanna testify
Make it crystal clear
(take your time)

See I've been picked out to be picked on
(oh lord)
Talked about outta my friends mouth
I've been beat down
(pray)
'Til He turned my life around
(turn my life around)

Seems like I always fall short of being worthy
'Cause I ain't good enough
But He still love me

I ain't no superstar
The spotlight ain't shining on me
(no no no no no)
'Cause I ain't good enough
But He still love me love me

I used to wake up somedays
And wish I'd stayed asleep
(Why can't she get up)
'Cause I went to bed on top of the world
Today the world's on top of me

Everybody's got opinions
(they share)
They ain't been in my position
(they don't care)
That it breaks my heart
When I hear what they have to say about me yeah

Seems like I always fall short (falling short)
Of being worthy (Lord I ain't worthy)
'Cause I ain't good enough (no no)
But he still love me (still love me)

Shunned by the world

If I don't succeed
'Cause I ain't good enough
But He still love me
(I just ain't good enough)
But You love

If you ain't worthy just raise your hands
And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed to be loved, loved

Stand for Him or fall for anything
'Cause through His eyes we all look the same
What will we do without pain

Feels like we always fall short of being worthy
(we are not worthy)
'Cause I ain't good enough
But He still love me

I ain't no superstar
(I ain't no superstar)
The spotlight ain't shining on me

'Cause I ain't good enough
But You still love me

It doesn't matter where you been
Or what you did wrong

It doesn't matter who you are
You're always welcome
It only matters that your heart believes
And you confess

If you committed any sin you'll be forgiven

Callin on all of God's children
Time to come home
If you wanna be delivered
Time to come home
I've been rescued by the savior
Time to come home
If you wanna be in His favor
Time to come home

Come on home
Come on come on home
oooh yeah yeah

If you cant see your way out
And you're drowning in your regrets

If you have everything you want
But you still cant find happiness

Cuz when you feel like you're forsaken
Life can be so hopeless

Maybe you need to come home
So your life can be planned

Oooh

God's children
Time to come home
If you wanna be delivered
Time to come home
I've been rescued by the savior
Time to come home
If you wanna be

Come unto him and he will give you rest
For any heart that's heavy laden for salvation

There's three things I like about the summertime
Drop tops, long hot nights and summer love
Yeah
Hey yo, B
Tell 'em what time it is
Let' s go

[Beyonce]
Out of all the guys that approached me
Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited a while and took your time
You don't know how impressing
Your curiousity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I

[Break - Beyonce]
I wanted more than just a man (man)
I needed a friend (I want a friend)
Someone I can talk to (oh)
Someone who'll really listen (yeah)
When you touched my hand (yeah yeah)
The sun got brighter then (brighter then)
Trusting you I closed my eyes
And felt our love begin

[Chorus - Beyonce]
It was the summertime (when we fell in love)
It was the summertime (when heaven shined on us)
It was the summertime (baby there is nothing like the)
Summertime, summertime (ohh)

[Beyonce]
Now it's been a year and we're closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside
For me and now you are my prize
Wanna grow old with ya
Fill a house with ya pictures
Have a son for you, a little girl for me
Together we'll raise a family

[Break - Beyonce]
I wanted more then just a man
I needed a friend
You are my best friend (yeah)
Someone I could talk to
Someone who'll really listen (yeah)
When you touched my hand (yeah)
The sun got brighter then (brighter then)
Trusting you I closed my eyes
and felt our love begin

[Chorus]

[P. Diddy]
Yo let me holla at you for a sec
So what's in gonna be, him or me? (yeah)
We can cruise the world for pearls
And bare boots for girls
Summertime in the linen, fresh fruit
Livin the life that's forbidden for just you (let's go)
No worries you ain't gotta be stressed out
No hurries you ain't gotta be rushed out
Sit back relax ma take your time
Now have a taste of the finest wine
Every minute that we have's a blessing to me
And in your heart you's a "Child of Destiny" (that's right)
Them hot summers that we had especially
Love who you is girl, you bring out the best of me
And it's like that, you know it's like that (that's right)
And that's your plan, where's your hand let me ice that
You my heart ain't no chance you could fight that
The summertime, when you hot baby take that, take that
Yeah..

[Jay-Z:] Uh-huh

[Beyonce:] Let's go get 'em
[Jay-Z:] Uh-huh
C'mon

[Jay-Z Rap]
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B ([Beyonce:] Boy you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me whipping curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting
Stand back

[Verse 1]
Baby seems like everywhere I go
I see you, from your eyes, your smile
It's like I breathe you, helplessly I reminisce
Don't want to compare nobody to you

[Pre-Hook]
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
Oh

[Hook]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu

[Verse 2]
Seeing things that I know can't be
Am I dreaming? When I saw you walking past me
Almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
It's like I'm losing it

[Pre-hook]
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go, oh

[Hook]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu

[Jay-Z Rap 2]
Yes! Hova's flow so unusual
Baby, girl you should already know
It's H-O, light up the dro'
'Cause you gon' need help tryna study my bounce, flow, blow
What's the difference?
One, you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dough, po-po try to convict him
That's a no-go
My dough keep the scales tipping like 4-4's
Like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow, wind so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever, that's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits, like a factory
I'm just one-to-one, nothin' after me
No Deja Vu, just me and my, Oh

[Bridge]
Baby I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Deja Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missing you
That I'm having Deja Vu

[Pre-hook]
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
Whoo...

[Hook]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu

[Pre-Chorus:]
I ain't worried doing me tonight
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody
While you all standin' on the wall
I'm the one tonight
Getting bodied, getting bodied, getting bodied, getting bodied
Want my body
Won't you get me bodied
You want my body
Won't you get me bodied (hey)

[Chorus:]
Can you get me bodied
I wanna be myself tonight

I wanna be myself tonight
Don't you see my body?

Wanna party, wanna dance, wanna be myself tonight, me bodied

[Verse 2:]

Wanna dance, wanna party wanna be myself tonight

[Chorus]

Baby all I want is to let it go
Ain't no worries, oh

And your body's touching my body
All I need is to let it be

Don't stop just come closer to me
While we grind to the beat
With your body touching my body

Come her boy let me work on you
Damn that was so good I wanna buy him a short set

Hey, hey

Dropping everything that's what I'll do
Whatever I get you putting it on

[Chorus]

Cause I'm a suga ma-ma-mama

[Jay-Z:]
I be the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the Jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz oughta do
It's big balling baby when I'm courting you

I'm talking spy bags
And fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg and rumors
You on the verge
Of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger is like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse

It's humorous to me they watching
And we just yachting island hopping off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, oh baby you ever seen Saturn
No, not the car but everywhere we are
You're sure to see stars.
This is high level not eye level,
My bezel courtesy of Audemars

I order yours tomorrow now
Look at the time I saved you
Mama let me upgrade you

Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me
You my project celebrity
I keep your name hot in them streets

But it's that little glimpse of light
That makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star
But unless your flawless
Then your dynasty ain't complete without a chief like me

Partner let me upgrade you
Audemars-Piguet you
You switch your neckties to purple labels
Upgrade you

Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm?
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

[Chorus:]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Getting the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go
Couped in the 'bach or the Rolls
If I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go

[Verse 1:]
Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know,
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog?
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke?

[Pre-Chorus 1:]
You can't stay, you gotta go.
Ain't no other chicks spending your dough
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her
Is what I hate most?
I don't want you but I want it
And I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

[Pre-Chorus 2:]
He's so arrogant and bold (Oh)
She gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call, time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'ma 'cause

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it baby? Is that the price that I pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All has been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?
You know I hate sleeping alone
But you said that you would soon be home
But baby that was a long time ago

I'm not feelin' it [2x]

On top of you not calling me back
You see I bet you think it's all on track
And you actin' like it's all a dat

I'm not feelin' it [2x]

Let's go, let's go Little Kitty Kat

Acting like I'm not nobody

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left (mmmmmm)
To the left, to the left

Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, please don't touch (Don't touch)
And keep talking that mess that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time
And, it's my name that's on that jag
So come move your bags, let me call you a cab

Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought, that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for
Because you was untrue
Rollin' her around in the car that I bought you
Baby drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' bout, I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable (Irreplaceable)

So since I'm not your everything (Irreplaceable)
How about I'll be nothing (Nothing)
Nothing at all to you (Nothing)
Baby, I won't shed a tear for you (I won't shed a tear)
I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you was so easy

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left (mmmmmm)
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking (baby)
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute
You can pack all your bags (You must not know about me)
We're finished (You must not know about me)
'Cause you made your bed
Now lay in it
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable
I wish I could believe you
Then I'll be alright
But now everything you told me
Really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Loving you was easy
Once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you
Have multiplied
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forgive this
But I'm much too full of resentment
Just can't seem to get over
The way you hurt me
Don't know how you gave another
Who didn't mean a thing, no
The very thing you gave to me

I thought I could forgive you
And I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you
I know it ain't the same
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forgive this
But I'm much too full of resentment

I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can
I tried and I tried to forgive this
But I'm much too full of resentment

I always remember feelin'
Like I was no good
Like I couldn't do it for you
Like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied

Loved you more than ever
More than my own life
The best part of me I gave you
It was sacrificed
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I tried and I tried to forgive this
But I'm too damn full of resentment

I know she was attractive
But I was here first
Been riding with you for 6 years
Why did I deserve
To be treated this way by you
I know you're probably thinking
What's up with b
I've been crying for too long
What did you do to me
I used to be so strong
Now you took my soul
I'm crying
Can't stop crying
Can't stop crying
You could've told me
You wasn't happy
I know you didn't want to hurt me
Look at what you've done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes
And see she's had half of me
You lied
How could you lie
You lied
Baby I see you
That look in your eyes
Hips that keep shaking
mysterious style
exotically tempting
familiar to me
That Creole Sexy it's all over me

So all my red bones get on the floor
and all my yellow bones get on the floor
and all my brown bones get on the floor
Then you mix it up and call it Creole
[Repeat 2x]

Creole! When I look real good
Whenever I talk real good
whenever I bounce real good
Just in case you wanna know the secret CREOLE

When she look that good

Ladies if you wanna know it's your secret CREOLE

I wanted to give all of my fans something extra
because this album was so special to me
and ut came so effortlessly.
after I finished the film of my life dream girls
because I was so inspired by Dina
I wrote songs that were saying all the things
that I wish she would have said in the film.
and I wanted to give you an extra special song
that Dina sings it's a pivotal moment when Dina finally does,
get the strength to stand up for herself and does,
know who she is and knows what she wants.
Im sure all of you women can relate to the lyrics.
This is, listen.
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete

Listen to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release

Oh, the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own
All 'cause you won't listen

Listen
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own

You should have listened
There is someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago

Oh, I'm screaming out, and my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worse
Into your own
All 'cause you won't listen

Listen
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own

I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't
If you won't

Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start
But I will complete

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you've made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own
My own

[Beyoncé:]
He said I'm worth it, his one desire
[Shakira:]
I know things about him that you wouldn't wanna read about
[Beyoncé:]
He kissed me, his one and only (yes), beautiful liar
[Shakira:]
Tell me how you tolerate the things that you just found out about

[Shakira:]
You never know
[Beyoncé:]
Why are we the ones who suffer
[Shakira:]
I have to let go
[Beyoncé:]
He won't be the one to cry

[Beyoncé:]
Let's not kill the karma
Let's not start a fight
It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
[Shakira:]
Can't we laugh about it
It's not worth our time
We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar

[Shakira:]
I trusted him, but when I followed you, I saw you together
[Beyoncé:]
I didn't know about you then 'til I saw you with him again
[Shakira:]
I walked in on your love scene, slow dancing
[Beyoncé:]
You stole everything, how can you say I did you wrong

[Shakira:]
We'll never know
[Beyoncé:]
When the pain and heartbreak's over
[Shakira:]
I have to let go
[Beyoncé:]
The innocence is gone

[Beyoncé:]
Let's not kill the karma
Let's not start a fight
It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
[Shakira:]
Can't we laugh about it
It's not worth our time
We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar

[Shakira:]
Tell me how to forgive you
When it's me who's ashamed
[Beyoncé:]
And I wish I could free you
Of the hurt and the pain
[Both:]
But the answer is simple
He's the one to blame

Beyoncé, Beyoncé

Heroins following Marilyn Hoppin'

River Phoenix
Jimi Hendrix
Jamie Morrison
All of them ended by
Hollywood

I see your face and a you wanna touch
come to my place and we can discuss it

Hollywood, Welcome to Hollywood
I'm a train wreck in the morning
I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I'm a puzzle yes indeed
Ever complex in every way
And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet, you see the picture clear as day

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you

I neglect you when I'm working
When I need attention I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfection
And you see past all that
I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
And that's exactly what I mean

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
He's always laughing
And flirting with me
And you act like you don't even care
As a matter of fact
You've been real distant lately
Acting like i'm not even there
He says that you
Don't deserve a girl like me
I'm starting to think that he's right
Baby

[Chorus:]
If you let him take me from you
I guess i finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you

[Verse 2:]
Why is that when we go out
Out together as one big crew
I try to chill with you
Dance or whatever
And your homeboy's more interested than you
He pays more attention to me lately
I'm tempted to pay attention too
Baby

[Chorus:]
If you let him take me from you
I guess i finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you

[Bridge:]
Boy when i try to show some affection to you
You act like you got better things to do
When you want some loving
Thats when its cool
But baby boy i'm not a fool

[Chorus:]
If you let him take me from you
I guess i finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me (wanted me)
Let this happen and it proves (no no)
That your love was never true (no no)
If you let him take me from you
(how could you let him take your woman)
If you let him take me from you

If you let him take me from you
I guess i finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves (just let me go)
That your love was never true (let me go)
If you let him take me from you (just let me kno)
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you
I'm so in love
I'm still in love

I've never been in love quite before
until I saw your face
and watching stars without you
my soul cries
my hething heart
is full of pain
when we're apart
the aching

I'm kissing you
I'm kissing you

You're my father
you're my soldier
you protect me, boy you save me
you're my best friend
you're my husband
you are my doctor, counselor,
provider, professor, my everything

And I love you, I love you, I love you, yes I love you
I need you, I need you, I need you, I can't live without you
I trust you, I trust you, with every ounce of me
Just teach me, boy teach me, just take me

When we make love I can feel all your spirits
deep inside of me
Baby you're so pure

I'm Kissing you forever, and ever, and ever
I love Kissing you (kissing you, kissing you)

Boy I love everything about you baby

be ourselves together
and I love you more than music

Oye, lo que tengo que decir
No puedo ya seguir viviendo así
Oye (uhum) como llora mi canción
Preciso tu atención debes oír
Hoy no sé quién soy ni sé adónde voy
Encontrarme hoy es mi misión
De tu prisión por fin ya soy libre

[Chorus:]
Oye...
Esto no tiene salida
Ya nada sirve que digas
Tengo que escapar
Yo tengo que escuchar a mi corazón
Oye...
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor voy a por ti
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz

Nunca quisiste que me fuera a volar
Callar mi identidad, que gran error
Hoy grito no tengo más temor
Hoy tu alumna te dice adiós
De tu prisión por fin ya soy libre

[Chorus]

Yo soy tu gran creación
Por eso es que me voy
Dime adiós, dime adiós

[Chorus x2]

Oye...
Lo que tengo que decir
No puedo ya seguir viviendo así
Ya me voy
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
llena de valor hoy ya lo decidí
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz
Mi voz
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll outta bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home (to come home)

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand
Yeah, you don't understand, oh
How it feels to love a girl someday
You wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

But you're just a boy
Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But, I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out!

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo...
Halo, ooh ooh...

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't begin to pull me back to the ground again

And it's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm taking
I'm never gonna shut you out!

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo...
Halo, ooh ooh...
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo...
Halo, ooh ooh...
Halo, ooh ooh...
Halo, ooh ooh, oh...

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo...
Halo, ooh oh...
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo...
Halo, ooh oh...
If I begged and if I cried
Would it change the sky tonight?
Would it give me some light?
Should I wait for you to call?
Is there any hope at all?
Are you drifting by...

When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)

And when I lie all by myself
I see your face, I hear your voice
My heart stays faithful
And time has come and time has passed
If it's good it's got to last
It feels so right

When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You, you disappear

I missed all the signs, one at a time...
You were ready
What did I know?
Starting our lives...
Now my love, I'm ready to show

When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear
You disappear, you disappear
You disappear, disappear
You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could have been
But still you live inside of me,
So tell me how is that?

You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I love to not forgive
And though you break my heart,
You're the only one

And though there are times when I hate you
'Cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me and put tears on my face
And even now, while I hate you,
It pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
I'm no broken-hearted girl

There's something that I feel I need to say
But up 'til now I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out

You say you've got the most respect for me
But, sometimes I feel you're not deserving of me
And still, you're in my heart
But you're the only one

And yes, there are times when I hate you,
But I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you
I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day

I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, baby
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl

Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah
Ain't gotta be afraid, my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away, away with you, yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't wanna be without my baby
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without my baby
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no
I don't want a broken heart
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
Broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl

No broken-hearted girl
She was lost in so many different ways
Out in the darkness with no guide
I know the cost of a losing hand
Never for the grace of God, oh I...

I found heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside...
Ave Maria

I've been alone when I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go on, knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down

You are my heaven on earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside...
Saying Ave Maria

Sometimes love can come and pass you by
While you're busy making plans.
Suddenly hits you, and then you realize
It's out of your hands...
Baby, you've got to understand

You are my heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside...

Ave Maria
Ave Maria
Ave Maria
Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I find myself in love racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love
And love was right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (run)
And smash into you

Ears closed
What I hear no one else has to know
Cause' I know
That what we have is worth first place in gold
And I'm soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong, oh...

I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
Smash into you
Oh......

Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I'm in love and I'm racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong
Oh...I wanna run
Smash into you
I'm willing to run (run)
Smash into you
I'm willing to run, run, run, run, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm willing to run, run, run, run, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I wanna run, run
Smash into you
I'm willing to run (run)
Smash into you
Satellites
Flashing by
It's a beautiful state we're in
But how can we love in isolation?
Think how happy we can be when we just try

We're nothing like we seem
Passionate words are never spoken
You don't know how I bleed when I leave your side

In your eyes
Love's alive
We've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites

Take all the rules away
How can we live if we don't change?
We're always on display
Let's run and hide

In our eyes
Love's alive
We've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites

If we don't communicate,
We'll exist in our own space
We have all the love we need
While we're apart, I cannot breathe

Diamonds used to be coal
Look young 'cause they got soul
That's why they're beautiful
And my heart used to be cold
'Til your hands laid on my soul, baby
And that's why you're beautiful

I'm not wondering why
The sky's blue. That's not my business
All I know is I
Look up and tell myself,
"Be patient, love. That could be us."

Lovers used to make love
And die just to give us
Their piece of the beautiful
Remember when we made love?
Love
Wasn't it beautiful?

Don't ask me why
The sky's blue. That's not my business
All I know is I
Look up and tell myself,
"Be patient, love. That could be us."

Diamonds used to be coal
Look young 'cause they got soul
And my heart used to be cold
'Til your hands laid on my soul
Somebody's got to stay deep in love
That could be us

That's why we're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful

Why, why

That's why you're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
I lay alone awake at night
Sorrow fills my eyes
But I'm not strong enough to cry
Despite of my disguise
I'm left with no shoulder
But everybody wants to lean on me.
I guess I'm their soldier.
But, who's gonna be mine?

Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help.
Who's there to save the hero
Who's there to save the girl...
After she saves the world
After she saves the world.

I bottle all my hurt inside,
I guess I'm living the lie.
Inside my mind each day I die
What can bring me back to life?
A simple word, a gesture
Someone to say you're beautiful
Come find this buried treasure
Rainbows lead to a pot of gold

Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help.
Who's there to save the hero
Who's there to save the girl...
After she saves the world
After she saves the world.

I've given too much of myself
And now it's driving me crazy
(I'm crying out for help.)
Sometimes I wish someone would
Just come here and save me...
Save me from myself

Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help.
Who's there to save the hero
Who's there to save the girl...
After she saves the world
After she saves the world.
Si yo fuera un chico,
Sólo por una vez
Yo me vestiría como quiero,
Con lo que vea primero y me voy.
Saldría a buscar
Chicas por montón
Mis amigos que son leales
Siempre van a acompañarme hasta el fin
Cada noche a mentir.

Si yo fuera un chico
Sé que podría saber
Comprender mucho mejor
Lo que es amar a una mujer
Sabría escuchar
Pues conozco el dolor
De perder a quien se quiere
Porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y quedas sin saber que pasó

Si yo fuera un chico
Pero ves no lo soy
Los chicos son de un molde
Y nosotras somos de corazón
Se piensan que son
Los del sexo superior
Pero cuando lo queremos
Nos vence nuestra seducción

Si yo fuera un chico
Sé que podría saber
Comprender mucho mejor
Lo que es amar a una mujer
Sabría escuchar
Pues conozco el dolor
De perder a quien se quiere
Porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y quedas sin saber que pasó

Es muy tarde ya ves para regresar
Perdonarte otra vez ya no lo vas a lograr
El lugar que ocupabas tú, ya no está más.

Pero eres un chico
Que le vas a hacer
No puedes comprender
Que se siente al comprender mejor
Y amar en serio a una mujer
No sabes escuchar
No te importa el dolor
Hasta que pierdes a quien quieres
Porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y quedas sin saber que pasó

Pero eres un chico.

And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say I'm the one you want
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost I'll be gone

You know I got my top back and my beat low-oh
Rockin' my stunna shades and turnin' up my radio-oh
Turn up my radio, radio, radio

I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound

Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
Whenever I hear that sound

You're the only one that Papa allowed to hang out in my room
With the door closed we'd be alone
And mama never freaked out when she heard it go BOOM
'Cause she knew we were in the zone

Hold him in my arms and look out of my window
(Under the moonlight)
And he be keepin' me calm so I'd never let him go
He's got a place in my heart

I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
(with my stereo-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!)
Whenever I hear that sound

When I get into my car, turn it uh-up, uh-up
Then I hear vibrations all up in my truh-unk, uh-unk
And the bassline be rattlin' through my see-eat, ee-eats
Then that crazy feeling starts happeni-ing-i-ing oh!
I get butterflies when I hear the DJ
(Playing the stuff I like.)
And I fall deeper in love with every song he plays
He's got a place in my heart

Turn the lights on!

Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you when I close my eyes
I'm going outta my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide?

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you

I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real and tell me you'll stay by my side

Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby

I get so excited when you travel with me
Baby, while I'm on my grind
And never would I ever let my hustle
Come between me and my family time
You keep me humble out of this hype
Cause you know there's more to life
If I need you, you will be here
You will make the sacrifice

Don't fly me away
Don't need to buy a diamond key to unlock my heart
You shelter my soul
You're my fire when I'm cold
Just want you to know

You had me at hello
Hello
Hello
You had me at hello
Hello
Hello
It was many years ago
Baby when you
Stole my cool
Cause you had me at hello
Hello
Hello, oh oh oh oh oh

Gotta feel you and be near you
You're the air that I breathe to survive
Gotta hold you, wanna show you
That without you my sun doesn't shine
You don't have to try so hard for me to love you
Boy, without you my life just ain't the same
You don't have to try so hard for me to love you
You had me at hello!

You had me at hello

Hello, oh oh oh oh oh........
Aw, baby, how you doing?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase, huh?
Some women were made
But me, myself?
I like to think that I was created
For a special purpose
You know?
What's more special than YOU?
You feel me?

It's on, baby let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why?
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

It's too big (big)
It's too wide (wide)
It's too strong (strong)
It won't fit (fit)
It's too much (much)
It's too tough (tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego
It's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up

Usually I'm humble
Right now, I don't choose
You can leave with me
Or, you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confident
You decide when you find out what I'm working with
Damn, I know
I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs
Matter of fact it's my smile, or maybe my eyes?
Boy, you're a sight to see
Kinda something like me

It's too big (big)
It's too wide (wide)
It's too strong (strong)
It won't fit (fit)
It's too much (much)
It's too tough (tough)
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego
Such a huge ego
But, he loves my big ego
It's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I, I can back it up,
I can back it up
I Walk like this 'cause I can back it up

It's too big (big)
It's too wide (wide)
It's too strong (strong)
It won't fit (fit)
It's too much (much)
It's too tough (tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego
Such a huge ego... such a huge ego
But, I love his big ego
It's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up

Ego so big you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, you ain't know?
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano...
I'm in this fight, and I'm swinging and my arms are getting tired
I'm trying to beat this emptiness but I'm running out of time
I'm sinking in the sand, and I can barely stand
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I try to be patient, but I'm hurting deep inside
And I can't keep waiting, I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me

I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I'm scared of lonely...

I cry at night, 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine, so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you would stretch your hand looking for mine
'Cause I'm lost in this dream , I need you to hold me

I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me

I need your strength when nobody is around
'Cause I'm tired of this emptiness, I think I'm drowning
I can't be lonely no more
And I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me

I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me

I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me

I'm scared of lonely
I'm scared of lonely.
Now, now, now, honey
You better sit down and look around
'Cause you must've bumped your head
And I love you enough to talk some sense back into you, baby
I'd hate to see you come home, me the kids
And the dog is gone
Check my credentials
I give you everything you want everything you need
Even your friends say I'm a good woman
All I need to know is why?

Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
And why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

I got beauty, I got class
I got style, and I got ass
And you don't even care to care
Looka here
I even put money in the bank account
Don't have to ask no one to help me out
You don't even notice that

Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

I got beauty, I got heart
Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp
But you don't care to know I'm smart
Now, now now now now now now
I got moves in your bedroom
Keep you happy with the nasty things I do
But you don't seem to be in tune
Ooh

Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

There's nothing not to love about me
No, no, there's nothing not to love about me
I'm lovely
There's nothing not to need about me
No, no, there's nothing not to need about me
Maybe you're just not the one
Or maybe you're just plain

Dumb, dumb, dumb
If I ain't got nothing
I got you
If I ain't got something
I don't give a damn 'cause I got it with you

I don't know much about algebra
But I know one plus one equals two
And it's me and you
That's all we'll have
When the world is through

'Cause, baby, we ain't got nothing without love
Darling, you got enough for the both of us
So, come on, baby

Make love to me
When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go
Make love to me
So when the world's at war
Let our love heal us all right now, baby

Make love to me, me, me, me, me, oh, oh
Make love to me

Hey, I don't know much about guns
But I—I've been shot by you, hey
And I don't know when I'm gon' die
But I hope that I'm gon' die by you, hey

I don't know much about fighting
But I—I know I will fight for you, hey
Just when I ball up my fist I realize
I'm laying right next to you

Baby, we ain't got nothing but love
And, darling, you got enough for the both of us

Make love to me
When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go
Make love to me
So when the world's at war
Let our love heal us all
Help me let down my guard

Make love to me, me, me, me, me, oh, oh
Make love to me, me, me, me, me
I told you how you hurt me, baby
But you don't care
Now I'm crying and deserted, baby
But you don't care
Ain't nobody tell me this is love
When you're immune to all my pain
I need you to tell me this is love
You don't care. Well, that's okay

Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care (la la la la) baby (la la la la)
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care (la la la la) baby (ah) (la la la la)

Ever since you knew your power
You made me cry
And now everytime our love goes sour
You won't sympathize
You see these tears falling down to my ears
I swear you like when I'm in pain
I try to tell you all my fears
You still don't care. That's okay

Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care (la la la la) baby (la la la la)
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care (la la la la) baby (ah) (la la la la)

Boy, maybe if you cared enough
I wouldn't have to care so much
What happened to our trust?
Now you just givin' up
You used to be so in love
Now you don't care no more

Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care (la la la la) baby (la la la la)
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care (la la la la) baby (la la la la)
I still care
I still care
I still care (ah)
I thought that things like this get better with time
But I still need you, why is that?
You're the only image in my mind
So I still see you... around

I miss you like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

Words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean them, why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to, why is that?

I miss you like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
I said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It don't matter who you are
It is so simple, a feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple, a feeling
But it's everything

I miss you like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
I said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It don't matter who you are
It is so simple, a feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple, a feeling
But it's everything
What goes around comes back around, hey, my baby
What goes around comes back around, hey, my baby
I say what goes around comes back around, hey, my baby
What goes around comes back around

There was a time
I thought, that you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy, I must've been out of my mind
So, when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I—I saw the real you

Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you
So, baby, good lookin' out

I wanted you bad
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had
You turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had
Oh yeah, I bet it sucks to be you right now

So sad, you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care?
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there
When I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and, baby, yes, I saw the real you

Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you
Baby, good lookin' out

I wanted you bad
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had
I said, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'll never be the best thing you never had
Oh, baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time, another world, another life
Thank God I found the good in goodbye

I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I will always be the best thing you never had
Oh, best thing you never had!

I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh, I will never be the best thing you never had
Oh, baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

What goes around, comes back around
What goes around, comes back around
I bet it sucks to be you right now
What goes around, comes back around
I bet it sucks to be you right now
What goes around, comes back around
I bet it sucks to be you right now
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu

I may be young, but I'm ready
To give you all my love
I told my girls you can get it
Don't slow it down, just let it go

So in love
I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight
I'll do it every way
Speakers knockin' 'til the morning light

'Cause we like to party-y-y-y-y-y-y
'Cause we like to party-y-y-y-y-y-y
'Cause we like to party

Your touch is driving me crazy
I can't explain the way I feel
Top down with the radio on
And the night belongs to us
Just hold me close, don't let me go

So in love
I don't care what they say
I don't care if they're talking tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night Oh Oh Oh Oh
That I give you everything
Music knockin' 'til the morning light
'Cause we like to party!

[Andre 3000:]
Set the scene, three thousand degrees
I ain't worried 'bout them fuck niggas over there, but they worried 'bout me
I got a homeboy named Butta and another homeboy, that nigga named Cheese
Fuck with me baby, I make it milk 'til it drip down your knees
Spit this shit for realo, Brain Brillo
Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old
Never thought that we could become someone else's hero
Man, we were just in the food court, eating our gyros
Yesterday, that's the way, every single mornin' I try to pray
Grandmom and them, they never forgot, and none else really mean none to me
I ain't stuntin' to beat, talkin' to me?
Girl, why you fuckin' with me? Move on, ain't none to see
Pssh, always somethin' to salt, I'm the raw, off the rip
Cause of him, all of them, will remember the minute
They fell in love with rap
Black like havin' your cousin back
Blue like when that rent is due
Cream like when I'm lovin' you

So in love
I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night
That I give you everything
Music knockin' 'til the morning light

'Cause we like to party-y-y-y-y-y-y
'Cause we like to party-y-y-y-y-y-y
'Cause we like to party

You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu, ooh
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, oh
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu, ooh ooh
Boy you'll be the death of me
You're my James Dean
You make me feel like I'm seventeen
You drive too fast, you smoke too much
But that don't mean a thing
'Cause I'm addicted to the rush

'Cause I rather die young
Than live my life without you
I rather not live at all
Than live my life without you
'Cause I rather die young
Than live my life without you
I rather not live at all
Than live my life without you

You know I've been in love before
You're the first one I ever seen
That burns like gasoline
So light a match, turn off the lights
I'm holding on to you
'Cause this might be a last night, oh

'Cause I rather die young
Than live my life without you
I rather not live at all
Than live my life without you
'Cause I rather die young
Than live my life without you
I rather not live at all
Than live my life without you

What I'm telling you
I'm giving you my life, it's in your hands
And what I'm gonna do
Is be a woman and you can be a man
And I wanna say
Nobody understands what we've been through
I rather give up everything
Than to live my life without you

Ooh... Oh!
Ooh... Oh!

'Cause I rather die young
Than live my life without you
I rather not live at all
Than live my life without you
'Cause I rather die young
Than live my life without you
I rather not live at all
Than live my life without you
I feel weak, we've been here before
'Cause I feel we keep going back and forth
Maybe it's over, maybe we're through
But I honestly can say I still love you

Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find

Let's start over
Let's give love their wings
Let's start over
Stop fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over
We can't let our good love die

Maybe we can start all over
Give love another life

I can see that we're not happy here
So why would we keep pretending when there's nothing there
Maybe you like it, well I don't
Maybe you'll settle, well I won't

Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find

Let's start over
Let's give love their wings
Let's start over
Stop fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over
We can't let our good love die

Maybe we can start all over
Give love another life

I know that this will hurt you
I know you'll cry
I know I called you selfish but that's a lie
I feel I know what's the best for us

Let's... start over!
And let's give love their wings
Let's start over
I'm tired of fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over
We both know that this love won't die

Maybe we can start all over
And give love another life
Bring the beat in!

Honey, honey,
I can see the stars all the way from here.
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near.
Every time you touch me I just melt away.

Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear.
They say love hurts.
But I know it's gonna take a little work.
Nothing's perfect,
But it's worth it
After fighting through my tears.
And finally you put me first.

Baby, it's you.
You're the one I love.
You're the one I need.
You're the only one I see.

Come on, baby, it's you.

You're the one that gives your all.
You're the one I can always call.
When I need you make everything stop.
Finally you put my love on top.

Ooh! Come on baby.
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top.
You put my love on top.
Ooh ooh! Come on baby.
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top.
My love on top.
My love on top.

Baby, baby,
I can hear the wind whipping past my face
As we dance the night away.
Boy, your lips taste like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again, and again, and again, and again.

Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear.
They say love hurts.
But I know it's gonna take a little work.
Nothing's perfect,
But it's worth it
After fighting through my tears.
And finally you put me first.

Baby, it's you.
You're the one I love.
You're the one I need.
You're the only one I see.

You're the one that always calls.
When I need you, baby, everything stops.
Finally you put my love on top.

You're the only one I see.
Come on, baby, it's you.

Finally you put my love on top.
Boy!

I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time
Know there was something that, meant something that I left behind
When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget

I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here

I wanna say I lived each day, until I die
And know that I meant something in somebody's life
The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see

I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know

I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here

I just want them to know
That I gave my all, did my best
Brought someone some happiness
Left this world a little better just because

I was here

I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I wanna leave my mark so everyone will know

I was here
I lived (I lived), I loved
I was here
I did (I did), I've done
I was here
I lived (I lived), I loved (I loved)
I was here (oh)
I did, I've done

When I'm here in your arms
I feel love in my heart
I can breathe
Not even pinching myself
I don't care
I'm with you, you're with me

I never wished on the star
When the star ain't got nothing on me
'Cause I can wish you in the dreams

When I close my eyes
I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep knowing that tonight you will be here with me, oh

Let me know if this is a dream
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (without you, babe) oh
Let me know if this is a dream
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe, about you, babe

So, I'd rather be here dreaming than waking up with nobody home
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
If it's the only way to be with you then dreaming you is where I belong
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh

I think the luckiest girl in the whole wide world could be me
I get to be with the one that I love anytime I please

I feel like I can stay forever beyond eternity
It's like I'm where I supposed to be

When I close my eyes
I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep knowing that tonight you will be here with me
Oh

Let me know if this is a dream
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (without you, babe), oh

And if I am dreaming let the dream be that I'm awake
'Cause I'd rather dream about you than be living life without me and you, you

[2x]
Let me know if this is a dream
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (without you, babe), oh

This is for them 20 somethings
Time really moves fast, you were just sixteen
This is for them 30 somethings
That didn't turn out exactly how your mom and dad wanted you to be
This is for them 40 somethings
Well raise up your glass and laugh like a motherfucker
This is for them 50 somethings
Hell, you're halfway there, baby take it to the head

Mom and dad tried to hide the world
Said, the world is just too big for a little girl
Eyes wide open, can't you see
I had my first heels by the age of 13
Mom and dad tried to hide the boys
I swear that just made them want me more
At 14 they asked me what I wanna be,
I said "Baby 21, so I'd get me a drink."

I'm not a teacher, babe
But I can teach you something
Not a preacher
But we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor
But I can make you feel better
But I'm great at writing physical love letters

And I'm crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?

Oh oh oh

Living in a fast lane, see you when you crash babe
This is for them sexy somethings
That body ain't gon' always get ya out of everything
This is for them bitter somethings
Stop living in regret, baby, it's not over yet
And this is for them trippin' somethings
That's high on life, baby, put me on your flight

I'm not a teacher, babe
But I can teach you something
Not a preacher
But we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor

One day you'll run the town
For now make your life what you decide
Baby, party 'til the fire marshalls shut this sucker down

I'm not a teacher, babe
But I can teach you something
Not a preacher
But we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor

I wanna keep it how it is so you can never say how it used to be!

Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch!

Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah

Baby let me put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's 'bout to go down!

You'll never need 2 'cause I will be your number 1
Them other chicks are superficial
But I know you know I'm the one
That's why I'm all into you
'Cause I can recognize that you know that
That's why I'm backing this thing back
Pop-popping this thing back
Drop, drop, drop-dropping this thing back
This is for the time you gave me flowers
For the world that is ours
For the mula, for the power of love
And no I won't never ever e-ever give you up
And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough
A woman in the street and a freak in the you know what
Sit back, sit back, it's the pre-game show
Daddy you know what's up!

Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch!

Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh-oh
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh-oh
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body

I'm gonna put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's about to go down!

I'mma take this time to show you how much you mean to me
'Cause you are all I need
No money can emphasize or describe the love that's in between the lines
Boy look into my eyes
When I'm grinding on you, this is beyond sex
Boy I'm high on you, and if it's real
Then you know how I feel
Rocking on you, babe, rocking, rocking, on you, babe
Swirling on you, babe
In my mind all I can think about is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past
And a chance to make this love last, oh, oh

Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh-oh
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh-oh
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body

Ms. Third ward, your first question - what is your aspiration in life?
[Beyoncé:] Oh... My aspiration in life... would be... to be happy.

(Uh huh huh)
(Uh huh huh)
(Uh huh huh)

[Verse 1:]
Mama said, "You're a pretty girl.
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth.
What you wear is all that matters."

[Pre-Hook:]
Just another stage, pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

[Hook:]
Pretty hurts, we shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation, pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts, we shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

(Uh huh huh)

[Verse 2:]
Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says, "Bigger is better."
South beach, sugar free
Vogue says, "Thinner is better."

[Pre-Hook:]
Just another stage, pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

[Hook:]
Pretty hurts, we shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation, pretty hurts, pretty hurts (pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts (pretty hurts), we shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

[Bridge:]
Ain't got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery
It's my soul that needs surgery
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake facade leaves you in the dark
You left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful girl

[Hook:]
Pretty hurts, we shine the light on whatever's worst (pretty hurts)
Perfection is a disease of a nation, pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts, we shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

[Outro:]
When you're alone all by yourself (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
And you're lying in your bed (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Reflection stares right into you (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)

You stripped away the masquerade (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
The illusion has been shed (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (pretty hurts, pretty hurts)

Yes
Uh huh huh

[Verse 1:]
And I've been drifting off of knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a psalm for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wander
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring
All these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels I'm touring
All these people on the planet
Working 9 to 5, just to stay alive

Flavor

I'm about to get into this girls,
This is for all my grown women out there

[Bridge:]
I can't wait till I get home so you can tear that cherry out, (turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out)
I can't wait till I get home so you can tear that cherry out, (turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out)
I want you to

(Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out)
I want you to
(Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out)

[Verse 3:]
Ooh I had a naughty thought today baby
Every time I close my eyes
Ooh get a glimpse of this candy paint
Don't slip off when it drip off on top of your ride
You see it here, Lift it up toss it babe
I know everything you want
I'm a show you how I stroke (stroke it)
Bring your work home on top of me
I'm a let you be the boss of me
I know everything you want
Give me that daddy long stroke

[Bridge]

Je ne sais quoi
Chéri, Mvlew
Aswe a, se net al kole
Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying

Because you're
No
Angel
Either, baby
Cause you're
No
Angel
Either, baby

No I'm not an angel either, but at least I'm trying
I know I drive you crazy, but would you rather that I be a machine
Who doesn't notice when you late or when you're lying
I love you even more than who I thought you were before

Because you're
No
Angel
Either, baby
Cause you're
No
Angel
Either, baby
Cause you're
No
Angel
Either, baby
Cause you're
No
Angel
Either, baby

Tell me do you want to ride
Tell me do you want to ride
Ride around, ride around
Ride around
You ride around in that H-town
If there's candles near your bed, no need for a spell
Stop acting so scared, just do what I tell
First both of my legs, go back on your head
And whatever you want, yeah baby I'll bet it comes true

Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying

Because you're
No
Angel
Either, baby
Cause you're
No
Angel
Either, baby
You're
No
Angel
Either, baby

No, no, no, no... [repeat til end]
Let me hear you say "Hey, Ms. Carter!"
(Hey, Ms. Carter!)
Say "Hey, Ms. Carter!"
(Hey, Ms. Carter!)
Give me some!

See me up in the club with fifty-eleven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sittin' low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
And every girl in here gotta look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm looking, babe

Boy, this all for you, just walk my way
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
(How it's looking babe)
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim
And tell me how it's looking, babe
(How it's looking babe)
And tell me how I looking, babe (looking, babe)

Drop the bass, man, the bass get lower
Radio say, "Speed it up," I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
The man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why do you think you keep my name rollin' off the tongue?
Cause when you wanna smash, I just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like like liquor like like like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like like liquor, like like like liquor

Drop!

[Partition]

Driver, roll up the partition, please
Driver, roll up the partition, please
I don't need you seeing Yoncé on her knees
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club
Now my mascara runnin', red lipstick smudged
Oh he so horny, yeah he want to fuck
He popped all my buttons and he ripped my blouse
He Monica-Lewinsky'd all on my gown

Whoa there daddy, daddy didn't bring the towel
Oh, baby, baby we better slow it down
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
And we ain't even gonna make it to this club

Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like (girl you like)
The kinda girl you like (girl you like)
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kinda girl you like is right here with me
Right here with me
Right here with me
Right here with me

Driver, roll up the partition fast
Driver, roll up the partition fast
Over there I swear I saw them cameras flash
Handprints and footprints on my glass
Handprints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blastin'
He like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty
Red wine drip, we'll talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdropping trying not to crash

Oh, there daddy, daddy now you ripped my fur
Oh, baby, baby be sweatin' out my hair
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
And we ain't even gonna make it to this club

Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like (girl you like)
The kinda girl you like (girl you like)
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kinda girl you like is right here with me
Right here with me
Right here with me
Right here with me

Hello!

[French:]
Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?
Le sexe. Je veux dire, l'activité physique.
Le coït. Tu aimes ça?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe,
Mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent.
[English translation:
"Do you like sex?
Sex. I mean, the physical activity.
Coitus. Do you like it?
You're not interested in sex?
Men think that feminists hate sex,
But it's a very stimulating and natural activity that women love."]

Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like (girl you like)
The kinda girl you like (girl you like)
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kinda girl you like is right here with me
Right here with me
Right here with me
Right here with me

Hello!
I'm in my penthouse half naked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at
There's just one shot left of this drink
In this glass don't make me break it
Wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling

I never broke one promise
And I know that I'm not honest
Now you got me yelling
That's because I'm jealous

If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Ooo I'm jealous
If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Ooo I'm jealous

Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and say to myself
Baby girl you can't survive like this

Take it one step further
Freakum dress out of my closet
Yonce filling out this skirt
I look damn good I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat
Boy you been hanging out at night
I'm staying out until tomorrow
Dancing on them tables
Ain't got no cares no sorrows

I ran into my ex
Say what's up to his bestest
Now we reminiscing
How we used to flex in Texas
Don't be jealous

If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Ooo I'm jealous
If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine

Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I'll never ever do
I take one look in the mirror and say to myself
Baby girl you can't survive like this, no

And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful
But that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous
I'm just human
Don't judge me

If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Ooo I'm jealous
If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Let me sit this ass on you
Show you how I feel
Let me take this off
Will you watch me?
That's mass appeal
Don't take your eyes
Don't take your eyes off it
Watch it, babe
If you like you can touch it, babe
Do you, do you wanna touch it, baby?

Grab a hold,
Don't let go

Show you now
Slow it down
Go around
You rock hard

[Hook:]
And rock right up to the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, babe, the peak, babe, the peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, babe, the deep, babe, the deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, babe, me, babe, me

Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Bathe in these waterfalls

I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this bass
Could you put it in your face
By the way if you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be your piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create
Rockets and waterfalls

[Hook]

'Girls TYME'

I'm out that H-town coming coming down
I'm coming down, drippin' candy on the ground
H, H-Town, Town, I'm coming down
Coming, coming down, dripping candy on the ground

[Verse 1 Beyonce:]
I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down bitches (Crown!)
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down bitches
Bow down bitches, bow bow down bitches (Crown)
Bow down bitches, bow bow down bitches (Crown)
H-Town vicious
H, H-Town vicious
I'm so crown crown, bow down bitches

I'm out that H, town, coming coming down
I'm coming down, drippin' candy on the ground

H, H-town town
I'm coming down
Coming, coming down
Drippin' candy on the ground

[Verse 2: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]
We teach girls to shrink themselves
To make themselves smaller
We say to girls,
"You can have ambition
But not too much
You should aim to be successful
But not too successful
Otherwise you will threaten the man."
Because I am female
I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that
Marriage is the most important
Now marriage can be a source of
Joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
Which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings
In the way that boys are
Feminist: the person who believes in the social
Political, and economic equality of the sexes

[Verse 3 Beyonce:]
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless
Flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless
My diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless
My rock, flawless
I woke up like this
I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
I woke up like this
I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
Say I look so good tonight
God damn, God damn
Say I look so good tonight
God damn, God damn, God damn

Momma taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine, I'm flawless!

[Verse 4 Beyonce:]
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Riding round in it, flawless
Flossing on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless
My diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless
My rock, flawless
I woke up like this
I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
I woke up like this
I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em

God damn, God damn
Say I look so good tonight

Sometimes these walls seem to cave in on me
But when I look into your eyes
I feel alive
Some days we say words that don't mean a thing
But when you're holding me tight
I feel alive

Make it last forever
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
You and I together
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me

Each day I feel so blessed to be looking at you
Cause when you open your eyes
I feel alive
My heart beats so damn quick when you say my name
And when I'm holding you tight
I'm so alive
So now let's just live it up

Make it last forever
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
You and I together
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me

Make it last forever
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
You and I together
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me

We've gotta hold on
I've gotta hold on
You've got to hold on
You've got a hold on, a hold onto me
We've gotta hold on
I've gotta hold on
You've got a hold on
You've got a hold on, a hold onto me

Make it last forever
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me
You and I together
Come on baby won't you hold on to me, hold on to me

Make it last forever

Mommy mommy mommy!
Can we see daddy?
Can we see daddy?
Miss you daddy...
You can taste the dishonesty, it's all over your breath
As you pass it off so cavalier, but even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all, my lonely ear
Pressed against the walls of your world

Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I'm praying to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me

I'm praying to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray you catch me

Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray to catch you whispering {whispering, whispering...}
I pray you catch me {whispering, whispering...}
I pray you catch me
I pray you catch me (praying)
I'm praying you catch me

What are you doin' my love?
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

Something don't feel right
Because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secret, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this?
Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'm a fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, and know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy, jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride?
No, they used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing say

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

Oh it is such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy, jealous and crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

I hop up out the bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up
I hop up out the bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up
Don't hurt yourself

Who the fuck do you think I am?
You ain't married to no average bitch boy

Ten times out of nine, I know you're lying
But nine times outta ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
All the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough

Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed
I'm movin' on
I'll always be committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad
But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't Bey, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, them old bitches so wack
I'm so tough, wassup?

Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me would stop this love drought

You and me would stop this love drought
We build sand castles
That washed away
I made you cry
When I walked away, ooh
And although I promised
That I couldn't stay, babe
Every promise don't work out that way, oh babe
Every promise don't work out that way

Dishes smashed on my counter
From our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch I scratched out your name
And your face
What is it about you?
That I can't erase, baby
When every promise don't work out that way
No no oh baby
When every promise don't work out that way

And your heart is broken
Cause I walked away
Show me your scars
And I won't walk away, Ooh
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, bay... baby
Every promise don't work out that way, no no no no no
Every promise don't work out that way
Forward
Best foot first just in case
When we made our way 'til now
It's time to listen, it's time to fight
Forward
Now we're going to hold doors open for a while
Now we can be open for a while
Forward
I love you more than this job, please don't work for me
Forward
Go back to your sleep in your favorite spot just next to me
Forward, forward
Tryna reign, tryna rain on the thunder

Painting white flags blue
Lord forgive me, I've been running
Running blind in truth
I'ma rain, I'ma reign on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I'm new

I'm telling these tears, "Gonna fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames

Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
'Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

I'ma wade, I'ma wave through the waters
'Til the tide, "Don't move"
I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders
Call me bullet proof
Lord forgive me, I've been runnin'
Runnin' blind in truth
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through your shallow love
Tell the deep I'm new

I'm telling these tears, "Gonna fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames

Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice (One, two)
Channel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards
Eight blacks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements by my persona
Six headlights wavin' in my direction
Come on
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqua ducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But, mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Honesty guidin' me
I can be me more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Cold on me, driving me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me
Like yeah

Open correctional gates in high deserts
Yeah, open our mind as we cast away oppression
Yeah, open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads

[Beyoncé:]
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
'Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

[Kendrick Lamar:]
What you want from me?
Is it true you see, uh? Oh, father, can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it true you see, uh? Oh, father, can you hear me?
Hear me?

[Hattie White:]
I had my ups and downs, but I always find the inner strength to pull myself up. I was served lemons, but I made lemonade
I found the truth beneath your lies
And true love never has to hide
Trade your broken wings for mine
I've seen your scars and kissed your crimes

So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on ya

They say true love's the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain
But every diamond has imperfections
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away

Boy nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became my remedy

So many people I know that they just trying to touch you
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on ya
Give you some time to prove that I can trust ya again

Niggas getting jerk, that shit hurts, I take it personally
Niggas rather work for the man than to work with me
Just so they can pretend they on my level, that shit is irkin' to me
Pride always goeth before the fall, almost certainly
It's disturbing what I gross (What I gross!)
Survey says you not even close (Not even close)
Everybody's bosses, to the time that pay for the office
To them invoices, separate the men from the boys
Over here we measure success by how many people successful next to you

Patiently waiting for my demise
Cause my success can't be quantified

Would have put Lemonade up on Spotify
Fuck you, fuck you
You're cool, fuck you

Anybody ever had an error
When things could've been better
Feeling like you was on a stretcher, and all you remember was the Hecklers
But the Universe uplifts that weight

Blessings on blessings, et cetra
Feeling like the best year ever, damn, it's nice

Louis V and Goyard trunks all in the closet

And my little baby Blue is like, "Who gon' stop us, huh?"
Ain't no way to stop this love, ain't no space if everything is love
Representing for my hustlers all across the world (still)
Still dippin' in my low-lows, girl! (still)
I put it down for the 713 and we still got love for the streets (ow!)

We played it cool at the pool of the Cancun, VMA
Confidence you exude make the fools stay away
Me, I played the room, let the fools have they say
Fate had me sitting next to you on the plane
And I knew straight away, uh
The next time we would speak was like two years away
You had a man, you shut it down until you two had a break
I bet that dude rued the day
You kept me up on the phone while you were away
You came back, I let you set the date, Nobu on the plate
I brought my dude to play it cool, my first foolish mistake

Cash, hit deposit, 24-carat faucets
Louis V and Goyard trunks all in the closet
Ain't shit change, the streets is still watching
And my little baby Blue is like "Who gon' stop us, huh?"
Ain't no way to stop this love, ain't no space if everything is love
I'm representing for my hustlers all across the world (still)
Still dippin' in my low-lows, girl! (still), I put it down for the 713
And we still got love for the streets (ow!)

I never knew a lo-, lo-, lo-, love like this
Gotta be special for me to write this
Queen, I ain't mean no disrespect
But the way I network, it's hard for me to connect
My first time in the ocean went exactly as you'd expect
Meanwhile, you going hard, jumping off the top deck
A leap of faith, I knew I was up next
I never told you, but I told a few people we wed
Me, I'm off to Rome, you going back home instead
My first time in my life a live nigga felt dead
You came back, I had to act like it was cool in my head
Thoughts of jumping the broom, a player never been swept

Cash, hit deposit, 24-carat faucets
Louis V and Goyard trunks all in the closet
Ain't shit change, the streets is still watching
And my little baby Blue is like "Who gon' stop us, huh?"
I'm representing for my hustlers all across the world (still)
Still dippin' in my low-lows, girl! (still), I put it down for the 713
And we still got love for the streets (ow!)

To all the good girls that love hustlers

If you don't know now you know, nigga
If you don't know now you know, nigga
Can you tell us about love?
Hmm, well there's love of children
Love of self
Love of God
Love of a partner
All of them have a different shape
But all of them is the same in the end
It's about sensitivity, it's about passion
It's about unconditional giving of self to another person
And there's love of humanity
That's the love that is right now needed most
Love of humanity
But in everything, in all of that love, there is a soul
It's like when you take some eggs and break them
And you take the shells and mix them up
Trying to find the ones that match
And you find the perfect match
When you find the perfect match
That compatibility results in passion
Results in unconditional giving of self

(Happy in love)

You did some things to me, boy you do some things to me
But love is deeper than your pain and I believe you can change
Baby, the ups and downs are worth it, long way to go, but we'll work it
We're flawed but we're still perfect for each other
Sometimes I thought we'd never see the light
Went through hell with heaven on our side
This beach ain't always been no paradise
But nightmares only last one night
(Happy in love)

No more clubs and Cali-curfews (one night)
Just private affairs in a tighter circle
Large format wines in small settings, woo
